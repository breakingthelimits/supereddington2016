RATIONALE AND PROGRAM
---------------------

Recent years have seen an increasing interest of the astronomical community on the topic of super-Eddington accretion on compact objects, which can apply to a variety of systems, such as supermassive black holes, black hole binaries, ULXs, neutron stars. Moreover, the possibility that the Eddington limit may be violated can have important implications for the related topics of black hole growth, galaxy evolution and AGN feedback.

This workshop will be an opportunity to compare recent observations with state-of-the-art theoretical modeling of super-Eddington flows, and to discuss the cosmological implications of this regime of accretion.

A registration form will be available on the website soon (http://goo.gl/5d4OBF). The conference fee ranges from 250 euros to 350 euros depending on career status and early/late registration. The early registration deadline is May 15th, 2016.

VENUE
-----

The conference will be held at the Arbatax Park Resort, in Arbatax (OG), a small town along the beautiful East coast of Sardinia. This resort offers a variety of lodging solutions and discounted prices for conference participants (as low as ~60E/night for the basic solution).

The Travel Information page on the conference website will be updated soon.

SOCIAL EVENTS
-------------

Besides the traditional social dinner, during this workshop we will organize a visit to the recently commissioned Sardinia Radio Telescope (http://srt.inaf.it), a 64-m antenna for Radio Astronomy, Geodynamical studies and Space science, with active surface and bleeding-edge technology, able to work either in single dish or in VLBI mode.
